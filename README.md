# ImageForegroundAnalysis
# These python scripts were used to automate image background extraction. As well as improving the workflow for large image datasets. 
#Canny edge detection uses pixel values to determine the edges of the object of interest. Therefore we can define a threshold and extract the foreground object from the image. For more info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector
#semantic segmentation uses the DeepLabv3 dataset for foreground extraction via AI.
#dupeFinder compares smaller versions of two images and finds duplicates using a small margin of error which can be adjusted.
